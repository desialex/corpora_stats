* _Per tree (node)_
	- [x] weight 
	- [x] depth
	- [x] MDD
	- [x] MHD

* _Per relaiton, per tree_
	- [ ] frequency (absolute)
	- [ ] left/right branching	
	- [x] branching = number of dependents of the node linked (directly) by a relation
	- [ ] POS tag of governor/dependent
	- [ ] branch length = branch depth
	- [ ] branch thickness = branch weight
